                    I don-not tag myself as a UI/UX designer, Front-end Developer or
                    Full-stack engineer. I enjoy conveying my thoughts through color,
                    shape and animation. I enjoy implementing some trivial clicking or
                    scrolling animations. I enjoy exploring different languages and
                    jokes about their strength and shortnesses. I use and learn whatever
                    I need to solve the problems.

Sometimes living with friends or peers can make communication and confrontation difficult, fearful of hurting feelings and causing animosity.</p>

                                        <p>We made some observations and interviewed students with roommates about their current cleaning habits. We found that most people wanted to live in fair and clean environment but were uncomfortable confronting others or delegating tasks. Additionally we found that people wanted to be doing an equal amount of work and those who were bothered by their roommates felt they were always doing more.</p>
                                        <p class="example">b) Storyboard</p>
                                        <p>Base on the problems given, we made three Storyboards to address different user needs.</p>

                                        <p>We created on a 1-minute video prototype that demonstrates a scenario where our app might be used and the potential users that might use it.</p>
                                        <p class="example" style="padding-top: 0px"><a href="https://youtu.be/N67aKIpWXeM">The video is very fun! Click here to watch it</a></p>
                                        <p class="example">d) Heuristic Evaluation</p>
                                        <p>Through the evaluation, people were willing to criticize our paper prototype, and we got some very useful insights on the flows. For example, we tried to include all the chore cards and graphs on the homepage to reduce the clicks that users need to make. However, it turned out that there were too much information, which is confusing users about what they should look at or do.</p>
                                        <p class="example example2">Here is the list of changes we decided to make based on the feedback form the evaluators:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>More efficient sign-in methods (include facebook, etc)</li>
                                            <li>Present less information on the home page (only tasks without graphs, or only one task per page)</li>
                                            <li>Add functions of showing pictures for both bought item receipt and house conditions.</li>
                                            <li>Add confirmation after users pressing “done”</li>
                                            <li>Think more carefully about the notification system</li>
                                            <li>Add some more description to tell user what they can do in this app</li>
                                            <li>Need to add a system to evaluate the quantity and the quality of the task (time, dirtiness, etc)</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h2>~Programming~</h2>
                                        <p>After the prototype, we made a development plan and started coding the app using node.js. We used JSON data to customize the pages, and we also embedded Facebook Login, real time graph, forms for creating new chore and shopping, retrieving old tasks and etc.<a href="https://home-ie.herokuapp.com/"> To see the full app, click here</a>. **Please use the app in a mobile view.</p>

                                        <h2>~User Testing~</h2>
                                        <p>We tested with UCSD students who are living in a shared home environment. These people are our main user base since many college and grad students have to deal with living with roommates in their own houses often for the first times in their lives. We envision these people using our app the most to set rules and organize themselves in a truly fair way.</p>

                                            <li>We seem to be lacking a type of immediate response or results from completing tasks within the app. Or it may seem not obvious at first that clicking done on the task or expense will lead to some type of tabulation or collection of data. Both subjects took some time to find the stats page and even abused some of the functions of the app by repeatedly ‘reviving’ a task and repeatedly clicking ‘done’.</li>
                                            <li>Our app is heavily reliant on internet speed and connection. This could be problematic if the connection strength is less than ideal.

                                        <p>The interviews provided us some insights about user needs. However, it was hard to detect what the real problems were. <br/>
                                            For example, it was hard to tell what people were really stressed about their roommates.<strong> Did they had different definition of “clean”, which resulting unequal work distribution? Is the work distribution related to individual’s schedule? Or, are some people really doing more than others as they feel? </strong> Currently, our app is trying to provide subjective data to reveal the actual work distribution. However, these are the questions we definitely need to further explore to really solve the problem rather than just providing subjective reference.</p>
                                        <h2>~User Testing~</h2>
                                        <p>When we did user testing for the first version of our app, I had some very important lesson. Since we had very little time to finish this app, we really focused on making everything functional, but we did not pay much attention on the details of the layout of the components on the screen. However, it was those missed details led users to misusing or not noticing the functions we implemented. Therefore, after this user testing, we decided to split the work of front-end coding and back-end coding to make sure we are making progress parallely. </p>

                                    <p>When we interview people, it was hard to make people say what they did not like abou the apps, because people usually internalize the problems they encounter; they blame themselves but not the product. <br/>Also, when we ask people about the senarios they use the music apps, we usually get very broad answers.</p>
                                    <p>Therefore, to get a better interview results, we digged deeper by asking questions with more specific key words, such as when, where and how. Also, instead of asking "what did you dislike about ...", we asked questions like "what obstacles have you encountered when.." or "what were you trying to do and how would you have wished to do it".</p>
                                    <h2>~UX Comperation~</h2>
                                    <p>When we compare the user experience across various apps, we found that main stream music apps usually has very simillar features and working flows.</p>
                                    <p>Therefore, we also looked up some foregin music apps, and found some distinctive differences in features and information displays.</p>

                                    <p>The biggest difference we decided to make is the pop-out overlay search on the playlist page (which is intended for users to add songs while staying on the playlist page). This was one of the most difficult decisions we ended up having to make with our prototype redesign. On one hand, the three dot menu is something we decided to use in other aspects of our prototype. Our first thought was that to maintain consistency we should continue to utilize that three dot menu, but in taking more time to consider we felt that it may not intuitively match the function of this overlay. We felt that in using this “add songs” function within a playlist the user would be seeking to add most likely a singular song to just that playlist. This could make the other actions that come with the three dot pop up menu somewhat unneeded. Thus we determined there was more of a pay off in utilizing a one-action plus sign button to add a song within this function was an intuitive simplification of the process.</p>
